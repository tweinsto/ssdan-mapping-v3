      Topics include population growth, race and ethnicity, income and poverty, and educational attainment. Users can dive into specific metrics like median earnings, income inequality, racial population shifts, and more. State-level pages feature county breakdowns, nativity and age-based race distributions, and unique visualizations like mirrored bar charts and pyramid graphs.

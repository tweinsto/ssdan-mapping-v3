    <h2>Understanding the Data</h2>
    <p>
      This website displays information about U.S. counties and states, including trends in population, race and ethnicity, income, poverty, and education. The numbers shown are based on official census data and represent estimates for 2023 or comparisons between earlier years and 2023.
    </p>

    <h2>Basic Statistics Explained</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Percentages:</strong> Show how large one group is compared to the whole. For example, the percent of people in poverty or the percent of a population that is Hispanic.</li>
      <li><strong>Ratios:</strong> Compare two quantities. For example, the ratio of men to women working full-time.</li>
      <li><strong>Percent Change:</strong> Measures how much a number increased or decreased over time. For example, the percent change in population from 2000 to 2023.</li>
      <li><strong>Standardizing:</strong> Helps make fair comparisons by converting counts to percentages or averages per person. This lets users compare counties of different sizes.</li>
      <li><strong>Income Quintiles:</strong> Show how income is distributed. Each quintile represents 20% of the population, from the lowest to the highest income groups.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Read the Maps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Each map shows data by geographic area (state or county).</li>
      <li>Darker or brighter shades usually mean higher values. Lighter colors often represent lower values.</li>
      <li>Hovering or clicking may show exact numbers or send you to a more detailed page.</li>
      <li>Clicking a state on a national map opens a zoomed-in map showing that state’s counties.</li>
      <li>Legends explain what the map colors mean — always refer to the legend to understand the values.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Went Into the Data and Visuals</h2>
    <p>
      The data used on this site is pulled from the most recent national surveys and grouped by location. In some cases, values from multiple tables were combined to create more complete indicators — such as income by educational attainment or race by nativity.
    </p>
    <p>
      County and state codes were used to keep the geography accurate. When showing changes over time, values were matched by location and then used to calculate growth or decline. In charts, categories are organized clearly to highlight major patterns or gaps.
    </p>

    <h2>Using the Site</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the menu on the left side of each page to switch between different topics.</li>
      <li>Click anywhere on a map to dive deeper into a specific state.</li>
      <li>Charts appear below or next to maps and will update depending on what state or category is selected.</li>
      <li>If something looks off, make sure your browser is zoomed at 100% and refresh the page.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who This Site Is For</h2>
    <p>
      This site is designed for students, educators, policymakers, and anyone curious about how social and economic conditions vary across the U.S. It aims to simplify complex data into clear, useful insights.
